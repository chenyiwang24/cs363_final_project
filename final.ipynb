    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project in this class, you will participate in a machine learning competition where you’ll apply your ML skills to a real-world dataset. You may work individually or in teams of up to 3 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this competition comes from the Austin Animal Center, the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States. It contains historical records of animals that have entered the shelter, including details such as species, breed, age, intake type, medical condition, and other attributes. Each animal in the dataset has a recorded outcome, which represents what eventually happened to the animal after entering the shelter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this competition is to build a machine learning model that predicts the final outcome of each animal admitted to the shelter, based on its intake characteristics. The possible outcomes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Adopted* – The animal was placed into a new home.<br>\n",
    "*Return to Owner* – The animal was reclaimed by its original owner.<br>\n",
    "*Euthanasia* – The animal was humanely euthanized due to medical or behavioral concerns.<br>\n",
    "*Died* – The animal passed away while in the shelter’s care.<br>\n",
    "*Transfer* – The animal was moved to another shelter or rescue organization.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By accurately predicting these outcomes, your model can help identify factors that influence an animal's journey through the shelter system and potentially aid in improving adoption and survival rates, shelter policies, or allocation of resources.\n"
